# GLOBAL-LIFE-EXPECTANCY-ANALYSIS-FOR-1990
This project examines global life expectancy as of 1990. Its goal is to understand the factors that affect life expectancy and make recommendations that can improve global life expectancy.
At the end of the analysis, the following insights and recommendations were made:

**OBSERVATIONS**

1.  The country with the highest life expectancy is Japan

2. The continent with the most life expectancy is Asia.

3.  Namibia has the highest UNDP Human Development Index rating

4.  The northern hemisphere had better life expectancy than the southern hemisphere.

5.  The region most rated by the UNDP is the sub-Saharan Africa region.

6. It was also observed that regions with high UNDP ratings, which ought to have high life expectancy, experienced low life expectancy.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

1.  Japan and the Asian continent had the highest life expectancy globally even with the not-so-good relative UNDP human development index.
    Other continents and countries should study the economic policies of Japan and the Asian continent and implement them as this will in turn reduce the mortality rates in other regions

3. From all indications from this analysis, it can be seen that life expectancy is not just a function of UNDP ratings except if there are other factors involved
   when these ratings are done. Thus, a proper review of the rating procedures should be done.
